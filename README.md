# irNEC
A genuine Arduino NEC ir-reciever software! Should  work on any Arduino board.
Arduino software using attachinterrupt!
Just find a pin that can use interrupt and try the software.
It prints out codevalue , adress and  repeat.
Just define IRPIN and uppload, serial monitor will help you to check which knob on your remote has what code and adress.
I was looking after a IR library to stm32 and did not find any. Looking to port one made me just confused they seemed overly complicated.
So i did one that should work on any Arduinoboard. For now it is a example and software all in one, because its so simple.
Maybe I will take me time to do it as a real library some time
